  summary: Starting as an occasional iOS contractor on and off from 2013 to 2015,
    I joined the company half-time in August 2015 and ramped up to full-time by January
    2016. Eventually, my responsibilities shifted from maintaining the iOS app to
    re-architecting the outdated backend, including codifying the data model, handling
    DevOps, designing and bulding an elli-based web app in LFE, maintaining parity
    (as appropriate) with the existing system and designing and building its modular,
    data-driven successor from scratch.

    mechanics.
