    Starting as an occasional iOS contractor from 2013--2015, I joined
    \hrefootnote{https://frontendmasters.com}{the company} full-time in 2016.
    Soon, my responsibilities shifted from iOS to re-architecting the backend,
    including codifying the data model, handling DevOps, building an elli-based
    web app in LFE, maintaining parity with the existing system and building its
    modular, data-driven successor.
