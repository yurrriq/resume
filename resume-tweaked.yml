      with a focus on automation, reproducibility, and company-wide cohesion
      through policies and best practices I help design, I work to empower
      developers, encourage and facilitate frequent shipping of code, and enable

      March 2021 to July 2022, I led a team of two, focusing further on providing
      a solid PaaS to internal ``customers.''  From July 2022, I transitioned into
      an architect role, handing over the lead responsibilities of our expanded
      team.
